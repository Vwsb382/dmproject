# CSCI 4502 - Data Mining Project - Spring 2018 | NYC Taxi Data
## Project: Catching a Ride in the Big Apple

### Group Members: Spencer Milbrandt, Rasheeq Jahan, and Peter Wang

### Project Description:
   This project was aimed to discover information that would be able to be applied to the underlying problem of
   predicting the best pick-up and drop-off locations as well as what the best time in the day to catch a ride 
   in New York City. In addition, this project strives to identify useful attribute correlations that can be 
   used to solve these problems such as identifying any correlation between distance traveled and fare amount to
   determine whether or not prices dictate the average distance traveled and thus dictate the most common pick-up
   and drop-off locations. Along with discovering the best pick-up and drop-off locations, this project looks at
   different datasets throughout the year of the NYC Limousine and Commission website to analyze whether or not
   certain weather or seasons of the year change the fare amount based on distance traveled. Overall, this project
   has created a base to be built upon to discover more information and apply it to solving various problems not
   only within NYC but other cities throughout the world that have a relatively thriving taxi service or similar
   transportation service.

### Questions to be Answered and the Corresponding Knowledge Gained:
  *What are the best neighborhoods to get a taxi?
  *In what neighborhoods is it more viable to take a different transportation service?
  *Do fare amounts really change based on trip distances?
  *What affects the frequency of the pickup and dropoff locations?
